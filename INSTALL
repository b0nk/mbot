These are instructions to compile and run mbot. Please check the README for
further info.

WINDOWS USERS: read INSTALL.win32 first, and then skip to "QUICKSTART".

PLEASE NOTE: I will not answer any questions related to unix environment, be
it copying and editing files, configuring crontab, whatever.
Also, don't bother to ask me questions on IRC about running mbot for the first
time. If you can't do it, maybe this bot is not suited for you. Try eggdrop.

>> PREREQUISITES

Mandatory:
- C++ compiler environment
Optional:
- libxml-1.x for the web module (2.x isn't backwards compatible)
- tcl 8.4 or newer for the tcl module (make sure a libtcl.so exists, not
  only libtcl8.4.so or similar, usually found in /usr/lib; creating a
  symlink might be a good idea if it doesn't exist)
- whois 4.x for the whois module

>> COMPILING

If you are upgrading from a previous install, first type

"make clean"

and read the ChangeLog and/or example.conf, because things change.

Then,

"./configure"
(some systems have a strange shell in /bin/sh, try "bash ./configure" if you
get the error "configure: Command not found.")
If you get IPv6 related errors, use --disable-ipv6 in ./configure.

and if all goes well,

"make"

If compilation fails in your system, contact me so I can fix mbot. I hope to
get mbot up and running in all recent unix-likes. Currently, I know it works
on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, SunOS and Tru64 UNIX. However, my main
development platform is Linux, so if something breaks in another OS, please
report it.

In case you want to use the ALICE module, you'll also need to get this:
http://darksun.com.pt/mbot/sources/alice.tgz
It contains the necessary data files to get alice talking and dancing. :)
Just untar it in mbot's directory. Also don't forget to see the README.

>> QUICKSTART

- Copy all ./example/example.* files to ./bot_nick.* (one by one, and of
  course bot_nick can be any filename, but for clarity's sake you should use
  your bot's nickname)

- Edit bot_nick.conf and configure it to your needs, don't forget to change
  the filenames.

- Edit bot_nick.users and change the mask in it (mirage!*@*) to your
  own, like yournick!*@*, and DON'T touch or add anything else. This
  should be the only time you'll mess with the user file directly, because
  it's safer to use mbot's commands to configure things.

- Start the bot with './mbot -c bot_nick.conf'. Then, inside irc, do a 
  '/msg bot_nick !pass foo'. Any password works, "foo" is just an example. It
  should say "Password correct". If not, try '/msg bot_nick !level' and make
  sure it responds with a "Access level 10, not identified.". If it doesn't,
  either the mask is messed up, or you didn't load any user file in the
  configuration file.

- Now at least change your password with !setpass, and use !help to explore :)

- If something goes wrong, try running mbot with the '-d' option, which turns
  on some debugging output and prevents it from forking into background. Also
  don't forget to look inside mbot.log for error messages. The FAQ is a good
  troubleshooting resource too.
