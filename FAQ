Q: !ping doesn't work
A: Make sure the ping command is working in the shell, because mbot uses it.

Q: ALICE module only answers "<srai>WHAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE</srai>" in
reply to whatever text.
A: Probably you cancelled mbot in the first time alice was used, causing the
data files to be empty and useless. Delete both alice/data/patterns.txt and
alice/data/templates.txt and rerun mbot (and let it build these files, it
can take a while).
